\usage{
SimpleSimulation(indvN = 10000, type = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{indvN}{is a number of individuals per homogeneous partition.}

\item{type}{is a type of simulation dataset. There are four types.}
}
\value{
The function returns a multiresolution dataset.
\item{\code{DataT$X[i,d]} }{ is a value of feature \code{d} of individual \code{i} }
\item{\code{DataT$Y[i]} }{ is value of target variable of individual \code{i} that
we want to fit \code{DataT$Y ~ DataT$X} in linear model}
\item{\code{clsLayer[i,j]} }{ is a cluster ID of individual \code{i} at layer \code{j};
\code{clsLayer[i,1]} is the first layer that everyone typically belongs to a single cluster. }
\item{\code{DataT$TrueFeature[i]}}{ is equal to \code{d} if a true feature is \code{DataT$X[i,d-1]} that \code{DataT$Y[i]} is dependent with.
Note that \code{d = 1} is reserved for the intercept value in a linear model. }
}
\description{
SimpleSimulation is a support function for generating multiresolution datasets.

All simulation types have three layers except the type 4 has four layers.

The type-1 simulation has all individuals belong to the same homogeneous partition in the first layer.

The type-2 simulation has four homogeneous partitions in a second layer. Each partition has its own models.

The type-3 simulation has eight homogeneous partitions in a third layer. Each partition has its own models

The type-4 simulation has one homogeneous partition in a second layer, four homogeneous partitions in a third layer,
and eight homogeneous partitions in a fourth layer. Each partition has its own models
